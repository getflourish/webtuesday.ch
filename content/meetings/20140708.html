<h2>J端rg Lehni: Paper.js and the mathematical magic of vectors</h2>
<p>
    Vector graphics are a very powerful visual technique, yet one the most underused in today's web landscape. As an abstract, mathematical description of drawings and graphics they offer a tremendous amount of advantages over the use of pregenerated pixel imagery or even fonts. For example, graphics described as vectors can be scaled, dynamically changed, easily animated, or respond to user interaction.
</p>
<p>
    These advantages can be leveraged on all kinds of devices and screens, as well as in applications designed for the production of printed materials. Their mathematical beauty invites for creative use much like a dynamic language rather than a simple manipulation of static content.

<p>
    This fascination with vectors served as a starting point for the creation of several software platforms, like <a href="http://paperjs.org">Paper.js</a> (the Swiss Army Knive for vector graphics on the web) <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/scriptographer">Scriptographer</a> (Javascript in Adobe Indesign), as well as a series of physical drawing devices that convey the beauty as trajectories describing robotic gestures called <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/hektor">Hektor</a>, <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/rita">Rita</a> and <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/viktor">Viktor</a>. In his talk, J端rg will introduce Paper.js, present a number of advanced Javascript techniques to work with vectors and close with an overview of his work bridging the gap between web technologies and robotics.
