<h2>Web components</h2>

<p>
    Web components are an interesting set of standard proposals, promising to make web development more modular and speed up development.<br>
    So - what exactly are web components, how do they work and when can you finally get them your hands on them? 
    This and more will be covered and we will see a few examples of web components in action.
