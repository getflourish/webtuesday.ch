<h2>Michelle Sanver: Graph Databases with PHP and Neo4j</h2>
<p>Traditional relational databases — ironically — are not that good at the complex relationships some modern applications need.</p>

<p>Multiple joins and complex sub-queries can gradually take a toll on performance.</p>

<p>Graph Databases, on the other hand, are all about relationships. In this talk we will look at using the popular Neo4j graph database with PHP to build efficient relational data for OmNomHub: not your average recipe site.</p>
